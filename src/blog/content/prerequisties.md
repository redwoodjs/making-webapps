"But, it works on my machine" is a fairly common phrase in the development community. That's because each machine has subtle differences that breaks down the expectations, understanding and experience of the developer writing the software.

Therefore it's important to try and match your machine as closely to possible to the one running in production: The majority of the time this is a Linux-based machine.

If you're already using Mac OS or Linux, great! But if you're using Windows, then I recommend using devcontainers.

###

NodeJS

Head on over to https://nodejs.org/en/download, install the LTS version of NodeJS for your operating system, using `fnm` and `pnpm`

I recommend using a text-editor like Cursor or VS Code.
